# IT1244 Image Classification

## Overview
In this project, we explore the categorization of clothes into 10 types based on 784 attributes of pixels. We employ four different models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to accomplish this task. The performance of each model is evaluated based on accuracy and Cohenâ€™s Kappa Metric. 

## Model Comparison
After comparing the performance of the models, we found that the CNN model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.911 and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.896.
